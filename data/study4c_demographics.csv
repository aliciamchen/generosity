While it's possible to interpret some of the scenarios as the other party being overbearing, I think might be over-reading the information provided, and that as a genera rule most people would be pretty happy with somebody else taking the initiative to do stuff on both parties' behalf."

0dcb9e02fe20cbdbfacf43a56d13448e,609302,female,32,yes,TRUE,The use of the term 'relationship' in the first few questions made me think it was saying the two people were in a dating/marriage type of a relationship. It took a few questions to see that that wasn't necessarily what it was saying. I do wonder if my answers were skewed at all due to that confusion in the first few questions.

d42c39265f14d248288dafaffbd5926b,530859,male,27,yes,TRUE,None of the scenarios provided enough information to determine how either person would feel about the situation. I don't know why any of those people made those decisions or if either person was okay with them. I have to assume that they're all mature adults and don't make a big deal of helping each other or not always getting what they want.
