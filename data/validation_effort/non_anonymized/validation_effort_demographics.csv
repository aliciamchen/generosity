559ecce6fdf99b16653fb880,530382,male,30,yes,True,The questions could be worded to be more clear and precise. They are pretty abstract.

5834a80a106ee1000120abd3,1058761,female,64,yes,True," The final attention check question asked for the participant to select ""extremely likely"" and ""extremely unlikely"" for the next two answers. However, those two options weren't listed in the answers. I selected ""extremely"" and ""not at all"", as it seemed that you wanted the two opposite extremes as answers. I hope this is acceptable.           "

59349d79f1b3f00001964d04,1144301,female,64,yes,True,       Everything worked well. Thank you.     
5a791168f49c9a0001f31061,645344,male,45,yes,True,Extremely likely and extremely unlikely don't exist on the scale. Extremely and Not at all are the only two choices.         
5aa83a71f6dfdd0001eb1690,301254,female,33,yes,True,            But the ending attention check did not make much sense.
5b7e118e87d85f0001baac27,839642,female,67,yes,True,"  Your last two questions, the attention checks, made no sense. The answers you asked us to mark were not available to choose.           "

5bc0b71202da150001352d0c,604319,male,52,yes,True,"The main question was a bit confusing as I wasn't sure if the effort put into the combined thing they did counted or you were just looking at the differences.  Like the question about 2 people going shopping and one carrying the bags up.  I put no effort by the person who didn't carry the bags up but obviously they had some effort going shopping.

Also the attention checks selections didn't match what you were asking me to select.  The second one said to choose Extremely Unlikely but that wasn't one of the options so I picked not at all.  "
5bda12b600c1c4000155cb87,363754,female,34,yes,True,           attention check question was confusing: there were no options that matched what was requested.

For example one person in the interaction might have been the boss and therefore would have different authority. Although one person's decision on where to eat might have ""won"" they might have lost the last time.     "
